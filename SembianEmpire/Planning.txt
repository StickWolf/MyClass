Jringolz  should run around in a circle between 4 rooms when the light is on, he can be stopped in the hallway if a gate is lowered
from above ground. In the situation where the lights are on in the hallway and when Jringolz is there he will
fall into favor with the player and follow the player around whever the player goes. The benefit of having Jringolz
with you is that he will heal the player every few turns.
